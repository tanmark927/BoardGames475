# BoardGames475
This is a C# and .NET-based project that allows the player to play a variety of games such as Chess, Othello, and Tic Tac Toe either with a human or computer player. These games can be played either through a console or a window.

The src folder contains the code for all components of the project, including the windows for the user interface and the logic for each game. The test folder contains files with a set of functions that test a particular aspect of the games, such as the application of a game piece and the presence of a possible move given the board.
